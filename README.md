**Project Overview**


The goal of this project is to:
•	Analyze a car dataset

•	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

•	Preprocess categorical and numerical features

•	Train a Linear Regression model

•	Evaluate the model’s performance

•	Visualize actual vs predicted car prices

 **Technologies & Libraries Used**
•	Python
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib
•	Seaborn
•	Scikit-learn


**Dataset**


•	File name: car data.csv

•	Description: Contains information about used cars, including:

•	Car name

•	Year

•	Selling price

•	Present price

•	Fuel type

•	Seller type

•	Transmission

•	Owner


**⚙ Project Workflow**
1.	Import required libraries
2.	Load the dataset
3.	Perform data exploration and visualization
4.	Encode categorical variables
5.	Split data into training and testing sets
6.	Train a Linear Regression model
7.	Evaluate model performance using metrics
8.	Visualize predicted vs actual prices


**Model Evaluation**


The model is evaluated using:
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
•	Mean Squared Error (MSE)
•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)


A regression plot is also used to visually compare predicted prices with actual prices.

**Results**
The Linear Regression model provides a reasonable estimation of car selling prices based on the available features. Visualization confirms a positive correlation between predicted and actual values.
